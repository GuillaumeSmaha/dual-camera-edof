# dual-camera-edof
Extract the EDOF from JPEG photos captured with Dual Camera smartphones

The result is a grayscale image depth map where higher depth is represented as higher luminosity values.

The resulting image can be used in a image editor to add depth specific effects.

Tested with a Huawei P9 but it may work with smartphones using the same technologies.

## Requirements

* Python3
* Pillow


## Caveats

* Original, non processed image not extracted yet.
* Simple and not throughly tested. Works in my setup.
